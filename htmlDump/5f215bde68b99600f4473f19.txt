Using <strong>Micro Mobility Vehicles (MMV)</strong> through a user- friendly <strong>mobile app</strong>, YULU provides a seamless, shared and sustainable first and last mile connectivity. YULU platform is simple, robust, scalable, supports multiple vehicles, and uses a common information model. </p><p>Yulu uses <strong>IoT, Machine learning &amp; AI and Cloud computing</strong> to deliver a seamless experience via a user-friendly app. Using IoT as the backbone of the operation, their dock-less vehicles can be rented seamlessly on a pay-per- use basis. Users can book a ride via the <strong>iOS or Android app</strong> and the <strong>smart bikes</strong> can be unlocked via <strong>QR codes</strong>.</p><p>After running the service with bicycles and understanding the need of the market, they decided to add electric mobility to their service. Looking at the gap in the market, they decided to design <strong>“YULU Miracle”</strong> which is a unique battery operated, lightweight, easy to ride, small 2 wheeler.</p><p>YULU Miracle has a maximum speed of 25 kmph and it comes under the exempted category where there is no requirement for driving license or helmet. It has been enabling individuals to take <strong>eco-friendly</strong> rides at <strong>pocket-friendly</strong> prices and reduce <strong>carbon footprint</strong>. YULU Miracle is using swappable <strong>lithium-ion battery</strong> and has developed highly scalable networking of charging stations.</p><p>Currently Yulu imports electric scooter kits from China before assembling them in India. In 2020, Yulu announced that it will manufacture 100,000 Miracle bikes in <strong>Bajaj Auto’s Chetak</strong> plant in Pune, Maharashtra. This will help Yulu to bring down its cost. Bajaj Auto also invested $8 Million in Yulu in November 2019. There are currently about 4000 Yulu bikes running on the Indian roads. Currently Yulu is operating in Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Bhubaneswar and Delhi. With increase in the number of e-bikes, the company is planning to expand to 56 cities across India, soon.</p><p>The team at YULU is driven by three guiding principles of urban mobility- <strong>Accessibility, Availability and Affordability</strong>. In the process they are empowering Indian city dwellers to bring about a paradigm shift by making urban commute efficient and eco- friendly.</p><blockquote>"We are passionate about design and innovation for urban mobility. We understood early in the journey that the form factor will play a major role while scaling YULU services across the country. With this view, we invested our bandwidth in designing India’s first sharing-friendly smart bicycle, <strong>“YULU Move”</strong> that is suitable for our local cultural and usage patterns"- <strong>Amit Gupta</strong></blockquote><p>Yulu provides an eco- friendly <strong>UMaaS (Urban Mobility as a Service)</strong> which is an affordable and scalable solution of the first and last-mile commute option to citizens. Their vehicles are designed for shared micro-mobility for Indian climatic and road conditions.</p><p>Technology is at core for YULU, as they are harnessing technology to solve complex urban mobility problems using unique and smart vehicles. Their belief in data-driven business, have led them to develop <strong>ML/AI models </strong>powered by data gathered from Users/IoT devices to provide better user experience and increase operational efficiency. </p><hr><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://startuptalky.com/sfarmsindia-success-story/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">SFarmsIndia Success Story - Buy &amp; Sell Agricultural Land Online</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">‘Buy land, they are not making it anymore’ a quote by Mark Twain, emphasizes the

Today many private IT parks are offering spaces to us to set up charging stations or parking zones.</blockquote><blockquote>The first mile and last mile connectivity should be adopted by every commuter to ease the traffic congestion. However, we need help from Government agencies to complement their solutions by providing solutions like dedicated cycling tracks, charging stations in public places etc. Public Bike Sharing zones should be available near every transportation or community hub.
